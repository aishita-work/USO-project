**Repository Description:**  
This repository demonstrates the principles of astronomical image formation, focusing on concepts like convolutions, Fourier transforms, point spread functions, Zernike polynomials, and wavefront errors. 
Implemented in Python, it provides a foundation for testing advanced techniques like zonal mapping, phase diversity, and speckle interferometry. While the study assumes ideal settings, such as continuous
wavefront sampling and error-free apertures, it lays the groundwork for future exploration of real-world scenarios in astronomical imaging. The project also highlights a hands-on approach to learning
Python for scientific applications.
